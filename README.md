## Usage

1. Enter the price of alcohol per liter in the "Álcool (preço por litro)" input field.
2. Enter the price of gasoline per liter in the "Gasolina (preço por litro)" input field.
3. Click the "Calcular" (Calculate) button.

The application will then calculate the cost ratio of alcohol to gasoline and display the result. If the ratio is less than or equal to 0.7, it will recommend using alcohol. Otherwise, it will recommend using gasoline.
